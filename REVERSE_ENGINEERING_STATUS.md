# Reverse-engineering status

The project is actively reconstructing the original YS-4470 firmware; it is not complete and no reconstructed firmware is claimed equivalent yet.

## Confirmed static foundation

- Target CPU: Allwinner F1C100S / ARM926EJ-S. The main raw image is linked at `0x7fffffe0`; its eGON payload entry/load region begins at `0x80000000`.
- Original V3.8 local SHA-256: `7e7d7230155fe0790eb48531de2ef463bb122c0ae1a820ab6d10cf2e60f50290`. Originals remain external/non-public inputs.
- The request/reply measurement FSM begins at `0x80004490`; its parser state includes `0x80004738`.
- `0x800073bc` is a UART receive ISR region with a buffer rooted at `0x805b408c` and a 200-byte bound.
- `0x80006e4c` is a sound-control gate which clamps its selector to 1–10 and invokes a lower sound routine.
- The likely diode/continuity result branch contains the established call site `0x80003a74` to the sound gate.

## Current version work

PyGhidra inventory tooling and a raw diff pipeline are committed in `tools/`. V3.8 and Beta3 have a first reproducible function-level comparison. Beta3 differs from V3.8 in 65 contiguous regions (931 bytes), including a static, caller-specific sound parameter override and a result-observation helper. See `RE_PROGRESS.md` and the session evidence JSON.

V3.6 is expected but was not accessible in this workspace at the time of analysis. No V3.6 comparison has been fabricated.

## Boundaries

- Candidate labels (notably `MainADCTask` at `0x80005a78`) remain hypotheses until independently validated.
- Static results do not prove display behavior, audible timing, live peripheral state, or measurement calibration.
- FEL evidence documents boot-ROM USB availability, not runtime debugging. No physical-device operation occurred in the 2026-11-04 analysis session.
